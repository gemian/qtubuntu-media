Integrations Tests:
-------------------
* Currently, the integration tests are disabled by default. To utilize them, you first need to
  uncomment the last line in tests/tests.pro (starts with "system"). Then from the build/ dir,
  run qmake -r .. followed by make. After it's done building, cd to each integration test's dir
  within build/ and manually run each test's binary.

Coding Convention:
------------------

This project follows the Qt coding style as detailed here: https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_Coding_Style
